    <p>How can i connect domain to my Website</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        When you create a free website with Wix, it comes with a Wixsite domain name built in (i.e., mysite.wixsite.com).
        To instantly look more professional, boost your credibility and help visitors find you online, you can also get a new <a href="https://www.wix.com/domains">custom domain name</a>, which comes free for a year with the initial purchase of an annual Premium plan. You can choose from a list of <a href="https://www.wix.com/domains/tld-list">domain extensions</a>,
        such as .com, .net, .org and many more to find the one thatâ€™s just right for your site.
        If you already own a domain name, you can always connect or transfer it to your Wix site.</p>
