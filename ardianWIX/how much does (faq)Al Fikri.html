    <h2 class="mb-4">How much does it cost to build a website?</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/how-much-does-a-website-cost">cost of building a website</a> varies depending on the features you need and whether you opt to build it yourself with a website builder or pay a developer to build it for you. 
      On a website builder such as Wix, you can build as many websites as you want for free, however, you’ll have to upgrade to a 
      <a href="https://www.wix.com/plans">Premium plan</a> to connect a custom domain and get advanced business features. 
      The cost of building a website may be significantly higher if you don’t opt for an all-inclusive platform like Wix.
